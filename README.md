# driveprojectmern
 Drive Project (MERN Stack)  The Drive Project is a web-based application developed using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), designed to enable users to store, manage, and organize their files in a cloud-based platform. The app includes user authentication (login and registration) to ensure secure access and file management.  Key Features:  User Authentication: Users can register, log in, and manage their sessions securely. The authentication process is handled using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure login and logout functionalities. File Upload: Users can easily upload files to the server, store them, and view their files in an organized list. File Management: Users can view, download, and delete their uploaded files. Responsive Design: The interface is responsive, ensuring compatibility across various devices (desktops, tablets, and mobiles). Backend: The backend is built with Node.js and Express.js, while MongoDB is used for storing user data and file metadata. Frontend: The frontend is developed with React.js, providing a seamless and interactive user experience. This project demonstrates the core concepts of full-stack web development with a focus on file management, secure user authentication, and dynamic content handling. It is an excellent example of how the MERN stack can be leveraged to create a modern and functional application.
